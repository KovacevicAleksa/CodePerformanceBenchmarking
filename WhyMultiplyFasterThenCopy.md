# **Why Multiplication is Faster than Copying an Array**

In a nutshell, multiplying an array by a number is usually faster than copying it. This is because multiplication is a simpler operation for CPUs, while copying involves looping and assigning values, requiring more steps. Several factors contribute to multiplication's potential speed advantage:

## Memory Access Patterns:

- Multiplication: Accesses each element, performs a simple arithmetic
  operation, and stores the result. This process benefits from CPU
  caches, as both the read (original value) and write (multiplied
  value) operations are localized and predictable.
- Copying: Although similar in accessing each element, copying often
  involves additional memory allocations and potential cache misses
  when duplicating the array structure.

## Operation Complexity:

- Multiplication: The multiplication operation (\* 2) is computationally
  straightforward and highly optimized by modern processors.
- Copying: Depending on the method (e.g., for-loop, slice, spread
  operator), copying may involve more complex operations under the
  hood, including array resizing and managing memory pointers, which
  can introduce overhead.

## Garbage Collection:

- Multiplication: Involves working with a single array and storing
  results in a new array of the same size. The memory management is
  straightforward.
- Copying: Some copying methods may create intermediate arrays or
  involve higher-level abstractions (like Array.from or spread syntax),
  which can temporarily increase memory usage and invoke garbage
  collection more frequently, affecting performance.

## Implementation Differences in JavaScript Engines:

JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) are highly optimized for arithmetic operations. Simple loops with arithmetic are often optimized better than loops that manage array structures.

## Cache Efficiency:

Multiplication operations tend to be more cache-efficient because they involve straightforward arithmetic operations that the CPU can handle more effectively. Copying, on the other hand, may involve more memory accesses and management, leading to less efficient use of the CPU cache.

**Overall, the specific nature of array copying especially when using higher-level methods tends to introduce more complexity and overhead compared to the straightforward arithmetic involved in multiplying array elements. This may lead to faster multiplication in observed tests.**
