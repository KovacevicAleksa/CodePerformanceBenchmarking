# Code Performance Benchmarking

This project focuses on benchmarking different looping methods for optimal performance when dealing with large arrays. It provides a web interface where users can generate random arrays with customizable parameters and compare the speed of various loop implementations for copying array elements.

## Features:

- **Array Generation:** Users can specify the size of the array and the range of random numbers to generate.
- **Looping Methods:** Provides multiple looping methods for copying array elements, including traditional `for` loops and modern methods like `forEach`.
- **Performance Metrics:** Measures and displays the time taken by each looping method to copy array elements, allowing users to compare their performance.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage:

1. Access the web interface.
2. Customize the array generation parameters such as size, range, sort, repetition, and buffer values.
3. Choose the looping methods you want to benchmark.
4. Initiate the benchmarking process.
5. View the performance metrics displayed for each looping method.

## Code Structure:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and form elements for user interaction.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styles for the web interface.
- `script.js`: Implements the functionality for array generation, looping, and performance benchmarking.
